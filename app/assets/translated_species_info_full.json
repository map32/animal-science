The head is strong, with a thick neck, and the body is thick in the middle and pointed at both ends, similar to a spinning wheel. The fur appears black when wet, but can vary in color. The legs are shaped like fish fins, which makes them perfect for swimming. The front fins are relatively long, and the hind fins can be rotated forward, allowing them to walk on land. The tail is short, and when males reach full maturity, they develop a mane that extends from the neck to the shoulders."

Only during the breeding season do they gather in schools on remote islands and rocky coastal areas.- Food: Squid and small fish such as herring, pollock, and sardines, mostly from far offshore.- Mating occurs in June and July, with a gestation period of about 11 to 12 months, and they give birth to one pup at a time."

In Korea, habitat loss due to the construction of estuary dams, reclamation of estuaries and tidal flats, and dredging of reservoirs, as well as the reduction of aquatic plants for food due to deepening of water depths, are thought to have had a negative impact. In addition, there are threats such as poaching, habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural land development and livestock grazing, and egg collection, and as wintering habitat decreases, individuals are concentrated in a limited area, making them vulnerable to poisoning and disease."

The Imjin River and the lower reaches of the Han River are the largest breeding areas, and other limited breeding areas include the lower Nakdong River, the Geumgang Estuary, the Yeongsan River Basin, and the Junam Reservoir.- Overseas: Widely distributed across the Eurasian continent from Russia to Europe.

The back, shoulder collar, loin, and upper tail feathers are dark gray. The lower neck, chest, belly, and underparts of the tail are white, and the sides are black with spots of gray. The feet are gray and have developed webbed feet for life in the sea. It's hard to tell the sexes apart by appearance. The winter coat has shorter horns than the summer coat."

It is a seabird that spends its entire life at sea, except during the breeding season.- Habitat: It lives in the open ocean (sea far from land) and coastal waters, and breeds on rocky islands off the coast. They feed in areas where upwelling (the rising of mid-level cold waters to the surface at depths of 200 to 300 meters) occurs and food is abundant, such as the edges of continental shelves. They swim in groups of 5 to 10 individuals and forage in the open ocean. - Prey: Small fish and crustaceans such as krill. - Breed by building nests in rock crevices and burrows or by digging shallow burrows under plant roots. Breeding season is mid-March to early July, with most migrating in late April and May. Eggs are laid two at a time, seven to eight days apart. The incubation period is about 31 days. The young birds leave the nest at night with their parents one to two days after hatching and migrate to the open ocean, where they raise their young at sea."

Rests for long periods of time in trees in the center of agricultural fields or at the edge of forests. During the breeding season, it breeds mainly in plains with sparse trees, but also in forests due to habitat loss.- Prey: Small and medium-sized mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, and sometimes feeds on animal carcasses during the winter months.- Lays two to three eggs at a time from late March to early May. The incubation period is 43 to 45 days, and the rearing period, the period of raising the hatched young, is 65 to 77 days."

Females carry an average of 508 eggs, with an average egg size of 1.6 mm. They hatch six days after fertilization. A single female is followed by several males who burrow into the gravel in groups to spawn. During the spawning season, both sexes are mixed color, with males having distinct bumps on the top of the snout and around the eyes, and the back of the gill covers are dark blue."

The pronotum is broad, and males have two strong longitudinal ridges in the middle of the pronotum, with two small bumps in front of the ridges. The ventral abdominal plate of males has a longitudinal indentation in the center, which is normal in females. The scutellum (small shield-shaped plate) is long and triangular with a deep rounded puncture, and there are three calf tarsi on the forelegs. There are two sharp, long spines on the outside of the middle and hind tarsi."

It has a pine-like appearance, with flat branches that overlap to form a large twig. The color of the trunk varies, but it is mostly white, with dark brown trunk and white polyps and sclerenchyma with milky spots. The twigs are 10 to 22 mm long, but the overall branch length varies. The phloem branches off the twigs at an angle of 45 to 55°, almost horizontal to the plane of the coral colony. The secondary branches branch anteriorly and laterally at 45° or more from the trunk, then extend horizontally and curve back upward at their tips. On all sides of the trunk, there are five rows of spines measuring 165×45 to 255×65 μm. The distance between the spines is about 45 to 120 micrometers, and the spines are curved, concave at the distal end, convex at the base, and slightly concave at the tip. On older parts of the axis, the spines are finer, sharper, and more branched. The polyps are located at right angles to one side of the branch."
